## Final school project : Twitter notifications for financial markets 

This project is designed to automatically publish tweets about financial markets . 


## Setup

# Step1

Create a twitter developper app . You can find a comprehensive tutorial here : [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2o_qt9cXicM)

# Step 2

Create a file _twitter_credentials.py_.
In this file, create 4 fields : 

- ACCESS_TOKEN=""
- ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=""
- CONSUMER_KEY=""
- CONSUMER_SECRET=""

Replace the credentials with the ones you've been given for your account (Make sure to also store them somewhere else as they might not be given again)

# Step 3

I assume python is installed on your machine and that you have a environment variable "python" linked to your version of the software
In the command prompt run :**python -m pip -r requirements.txt**

# Step 4

Create two empty folders :

- pickledFiles
- Image_Director

```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/youssk541/fnstatz.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
